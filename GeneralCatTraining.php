        <div class="message">
            <p>Remember that cats are individuals and may require different methods of training. </p>
            <p>If you're having trouble training your cat or need more specific advice, consult with your veterinarian or a professional cat trainer.</p>

            <p><br> 1- Positive reinforcement: Use positive reinforcement, such as treats or praise, to encourage good behavior in your cat.</p>
             <p>Reward your cat when they do something you want them to do, like using the litter box, scratching on a scratching post, or coming when called.</p>
 
             <p><br>2- Scratching post training: Provide a scratching post for your cat and encourage them to use it instead of your furniture. </p>
                 <p>You can use positive reinforcement to encourage your cat to use the scratching post, such as placing treats on it or using a toy to play with them on or around the scratching post.</p>
 
             <p><br>3- Encouraging good behavior: To encourage good behavior, make sure your cat has access to their basic needs like food, water, litter box, and scratching post.</p>
             <p>Avoid punishing your cat for bad behavior, instead, redirect their attention and reward good behavior.</p>  
             
             <p><br>4- Consistency: Be consistent in your training and use the same commands and rewards every time.</p>
             <p>Cats respond well to routines and consistency.</p>
